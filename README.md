# Employee-Attrition-Prediction-Case-Study
This project is based on a case study that focuses on Employee Attrition. The data is taken from IBM Watson's sample case study data. I have utilized data mining and basic machine learning algorithms to predict the Employee Attrition of a pharmaceutical company. One of the most important resource for successful functioning of any organization or company is the People resource. Hence, losing the right people from the company can be a huge setback. Thus, understanding the factors or reasons for attrition makes it, all the more, necessary for a company or organization.
